# 🌳 Arbor - Terminal File Manager

[![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)
Arbor is an interactive, three-pane terminal-based file manager built using Rust. It leverages **ratatui** for the Terminal User Interface (TUI) and **crossterm** for event handling. It allows users to navigate directories, preview files, manage files and folders (create, rename, delete), and perform copy/paste operations.

## 📜 Features

* **📊 Three-Pane Layout:** Displays Parent Directory, Current Directory, and a Preview pane (showing subdirectory contents or file previews).
* **📂 Navigate Directories:** Seamlessly move between directories.
* **📄 File Preview:** View contents of text files directly in the terminal. Detects binary files.(Lots of file format has to be added for better preview underdevelopment)
* **🔼🔽 Smooth Navigation:** Use familiar keybindings (`j`, `k`, `h`, `l`) to move through items and hierarchies.
* **📝 File Management:**
    * **Delete:** Remove files or directories (with confirmation).
    * **Rename:** Rename files or directories via an interactive prompt.
    * **Create:** Create new files or directories (supports nested creation like `mkdir -p`) via an interactive prompt.
* **✨ Selection Mode:** Enter a visual selection mode (`v`) to select multiple items for batch operations (like mass deletion).
* **📋 Move/Copy & Paste:** Move/Copy multiple files/directories and paste them into the current directory (recursive directory copy).
* **🚀 Interactive Popups:** Handles confirmations, renaming, and creation through clean TUI popups.
* 
## 🎮 Controls

Arbor operates primarily in **Normal Mode**. Some actions involve temporary popups or switching to **Selection Mode**.
